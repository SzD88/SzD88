### Welcome on my GitHub
I am an aspiring programmer from Poland, constantly improving my backend and frontend skills. I am currently working on several frontend and backend projects using ASP.NET and Angular.
 
My favorite technologies in order of most used:

 I wish to present two repositories.

 The first solution is planned to be deployed for use. This solution supports device reservations in the machine park of a small and medium company. The system offers authorized accounts for users with different roles who can make reservations depending on their permissions.
 
 This is a solution that has not been implemented yet and shows how I imagine a well-planned and architecturally solved backend solution. There was always time to refactor the code and keep things in order. I am currently working on implementing proper automated tests for this application.

 The second solution is a live living application, which I implemented for use in a small company. It is an application for organizing working time over several weeks with a convenient interface available to users. The app is calendar based and allows managing tasks for employers and showing important information.
 
 This application was introduced after recognizing the need and made on the basis of a previously owned repository.
Gradually, the user interface was implemented in order to quickly start the application and its tests, to later build up its functionality. The application never had time to be refactored because it needed to prove its usefulness as soon as possible in order to keep it functioning.
